This will be a PHP package that implements a client to interact with DeepL.com once they have published their API. I do not know if or when they will publish there API but I expect them to do it. Meanwhile I will use this repository to prepare the upcoming PHP client implementation.

This is not an official package. It will be 100% open source and non-commercial. DeepL is a product from DeepL GmbH. More info: https://www.deepl.com/publisher.html
